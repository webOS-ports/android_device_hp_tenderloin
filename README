On the 10.1-ugly branch is a semi working device tree for hp tenderloin cm10.1.
NOTE: I am working on a different tree (b10.1) that has a cleaner set of commits to bring up cm10.1. I'll be doing most of my work over there. 
It is a work in progress. Very much a WIP. 
Camera WORKS! Thank you Tomasz Rostanski (Dorregaray).
We nolonger need the changes to frameworks/native and frameworks/av. Dorregaray's camera drivers work without them. By work, I mean there is a picture, upside down, stretched, no Settings... still more to do, but an excellent start. 
Bluetooth doesn't work (somebody who cares should work on bluedroid, the cm10 bluetooth stack.)
but...
Now we have sound! Thanks again to James Sullins. You can remove more commits from the build script. 
You can also undefine -DBINDER_CONFIG and BOARD_USES_LEGACY_OVERLAY:=true from Boardconfig.mk but this isn't necessary. 
According to jcs he made things into ics libs. It's all magic to me.

but...
the SDCARD is mounted now! Thanks to James Sullins, aka jcsullins (who also made most of the other commits that get this working).

This is heavily reliant on the work of Arne Coucheron.
His invaluable patches include:
Not needed anymore: http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/34375
http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/34377/
http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/34374/
and his highly useful doc:

Without his work, I would still have no display.

All my patches are in one big, ugly patch. Look at branch b10.1 for neater, separate commits. I included various gerrit patches that my patch is dependent on.
Here's the local_manifest.xml (local_manifests/roomservice.xml) file I use:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>
  <project name="drmarble/android_device_hp_tenderloin" path="device/hp/tenderloin" remote="github" revision="10.1-ugly" />
  <project name="CyanogenMod/hp-kernel-tenderloin" path="kernel/hp/tenderloin" remote="github" revision="ics" />
  <project name="CyanogenMod/android_hardware_atheros_wlan" path="hardware/atheros/wlan" remote="github" revision="jellybean" />
  <project name="arco/android_hardware_qcom_display-legacy" path="hardware/qcom/display-legacy" remote="github" revision="cm-10.1" />
  <project name="arco/android_hardware_qcom_media-legacy" path="hardware/qcom/media-legacy" remote="github" revision="cm-10.1" /> 
</manifest>

Actually, I clone my repo into device/hp/tenderloin. https://github.com/drmarble/android_device_hp_tenderloin.git
(You know where it is or you wouldn't be able to read this). I included it in the local manifest here for your convenience.

I think that this is everything. 
If you figure out how to get the SDCARD to mount, let me know on freenode cyanogenmod-tenderloin, RootzWiki, or XDA.
